Common functions:
- Basic data frame analysis - head, na values, summary
- Automated data profiling - pandas_profiling
- Basic data preparation, in particular missing values and dummy variables (using fit and transform e.g. sklearn pipeline or custom class)
- Train simple model (e.g. regression)
- Model evaluation: metrics, confusion matrix for classification
- Train more advanced model - e.g. random forest
- Plot feature importance for random forest
- Plot loss vs iteration (train and validation sets)
- Improve feature engineering
- Plot metric vs sample size (train and validation sets)
- AutoML - e.g.: tpot
- Hyper parameter tuning for XGBoost
- Script for sumbission
- Neural network (tabnet, fastai, keras)
- Embeddings from neural network as features to XGBoost
- Hyper parameter tuning for neural network
